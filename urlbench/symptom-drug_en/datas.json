On the fifth day, I had a very uncomfortable cough and went to the hospital for intravenous therapy. The doctor said my cough was due to the mucus not being able to flow out of my throat. I tried coughing and blowing my nose at the same time, and that helped alleviate the cough. Today, I feel much better, but my throat still itches, and I still have a stuffy nose, runny nose, and occasional coughing. I would like to know what medication would be suitable. I have already taken cefuroxime, 999, loquat syrup with coltsfoot and fritillary bulb, and a box of heat-clearing and fire-removing medicine, which have all been finished.

I usually feel phlegm in my throat and my tonsils often become inflamed. The doctor said if the tonsils are frequently inflamed, there is a high possibility of chronic pharyngitis. There are several possibilities for the frequent phlegm in the throat, it could be inhaled from the posterior nasal cavity, or it could be due to chronic inflammation, such as chronic pharyngitis and chronic bronchitis. The third possibility is related to some reflux factors, such as frequent heartburn and belching.

After the examination, it was found that my liver function is abnormal with mild elevation of transaminases. I would like to ask if this is a severe case of liver function abnormality? The doctor suggested that I can either take hepatoprotective drugs alone or combine them with antiviral drugs. The doctor also asked about the results of my liver, gallbladder, and spleen ultrasound, and I answered that it showed severe fatty liver. I asked the doctor if I could start taking some liver-protective pills, and the doctor said it is possible. I also asked if this liver function abnormality is related to recent late nights and overtime work, and the doctor confirmed that it is indeed related. I further asked if I can continue exercising, such as running, in this condition, and the doctor advised temporarily suspending running but other non-strenuous exercises are still allowed. I also asked how long it generally takes for liver function to return to normal in this situation, and the doctor said it may take one to two weeks, and even longer if it is caused by fatty liver. The doctor also inquired about my height and weight, and I answered 182cm and 210 pounds, respectively. The doctor mentioned that my weight is indeed above the healthy range, so the recovery of liver function may take longer. I also informed the doctor that I usually check the hepatitis B viral load every six months and the levels are quite low, so I want to know if this is mainly caused by fatty liver. The doctor responded that fatty liver may be the main factor, while the hepatitis B virus is a secondary factor. I also asked if intense exercise and weight loss should only be started after liver function returns to normal, and the doctor confirmed it. The doctor emphasized that the key now is to follow a low-fat diet. I expressed my gratitude for the doctor's responses.",

Due to the constant discomfort and poor digestion in my stomach, I have been taking omeprazole and cannot stop. In February 2020, I had a gallbladder removal surgery and have been experiencing frequent diarrhea since then. Before the surgery, my bowel movements were dry and difficult. Half a year after the surgery, I could stop taking omeprazole, but the diarrhea issue still persists. Sometimes it is watery. I have tried injections and medication, which have been effective, but as soon as I stop taking them, the diarrhea returns. Every day, about 1 to 2 hours after finishing breakfast, my lower abdomen starts to hurt and I need to go to the bathroom. This week, it seems to have been caused by catching a cold. I tried taking Huanglian Su, but it didn't work. Then I switched to Levofloxacin and Bupi Yichang Wan. It worked when I took them, but after three days of stopping the medication, the diarrhea came back. Now I am a bit afraid to eat breakfast as it seems more effective than taking diarrhea medication. Regardless of the cause of my diarrhea, it seems difficult to improve, and this problem has been ongoing for a long time. Previously, I only needed to take one Levofloxacin and I would feel better the next day, but now only lunch and dinner are normal, and my stomach hurts after eating breakfast. Doctor, do you have any suggestions?",

I underwent an endoscopy and was diagnosed with bile reflux gastritis, but in the past few days, I have been experiencing pain in the middle of my chest.

The doctor said that this change is not severe, only chronic gastritis, and the majority of people have this condition, but each person may show different symptoms. If the Helicobacter pylori test is positive, it can be temporarily not eradicated. I asked the doctor about the treatment, and the doctor asked if I had symptoms such as acid reflux, belching, abdominal pain, or bloating. I replied that I would feel pain on an empty stomach when it's severe, but it would improve after eating, and taking omeprazole can also relieve the symptoms, although it would recur after a while. Sometimes, I feel bloated and want to belch. Most of the time, I don't have any discomfort. The doctor asked if my bowel movements are normal and if I can have a bowel movement every day. I replied that my bowel movements are not very good, I often have diarrhea in the morning, and it is watery, but I don't frequently suffer from constipation. I have tested fecal occult blood before, and the result was fine. The doctor told me that my gastric symptoms are related to gastritis. The doctor also asked if I often eat raw, cold, hard, or spicy food. I replied that I don't eat very well, when eating light food, there is no problem, and bowel movements are normal. However, if I eat a slightly richer diet, I will have diarrhea. Especially when eating garlic, I often have diarrhea.

I also have fatty liver disease. Two years ago, my HBV DNA level was 1.09, and last year it was negative. I haven't taken any medication for HBV before. My doctor advised me not to rush into taking antiviral medication like Entecavir. Instead, I should start by taking liver-protecting and enzyme-lowering drugs for a period of observation. I am 173cm tall and weigh 65kg. B-ultrasound results showed fatty liver, but everything else is normal. The doctor asked me to consume less oil, pay close attention to liver function tests and viral load, as the HBV replication can fluctuate naturally. Regular follow-up is necessary. My HBV viral load has always been relatively low, indicating that I may only be an HBV carrier, and the high liver enzymes may be primarily due to fatty liver. The doctor suggested that I should not take Entecavir for now but start taking liver-protecting and enzyme-lowering drugs. I should have my HBV viral load checked every 2-3 months. Therefore, I plan to exercise more, not take medication for now, but continue taking liver-protecting and enzyme-lowering drugs. Could you recommend some specific drugs for liver protection and enzyme reduction?",

If the symptoms worsen, I can try taking some nerve-nourishing medications and drugs that improve microcirculation. I can also consider taking sleep-regulating medications. Additionally, it is important to avoid noisy environments, avoid long periods of using headphones for phone calls, take adequate rest, not pay too much attention to the ringing, and engage in moderate exercise.

On the first day, I felt very thirsty with a dry throat and discomfort. On the second day, my throat started to hurt and I had a mild cough. I took some cough syrup. On the third day, my throat no longer hurt, but I had a headache and cough. I do not have a fever, and the cough has a little phlegm, but not much and I haven't been able to cough it out. Today is the fourth day, and I started having a runny nose, the mucus is white. I am in Foshan, Guangdong. Are there any COVID-19 infections in my area? Is the situation here still okay? I have no history of contact, so I shouldn't have contracted COVID-19. But now many people are not wearing masks, and sometimes we eat outside. Based on my symptoms, it should not be COVID-19. Can you explain the symptoms of COVID-19? Doctor: The typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and body aches, which are different from your symptoms. Based on your symptoms, it seems to be a respiratory infection. Today I have a runny nose, is my condition worsening or improving? Is the runny nose clear or does it have pus? Today my runny nose is white, I didn't have any runny nose in the past few days. Then it is a cold, not a worsening of your condition. After the cold medication improves your symptoms, it is still recommended to drink plenty of water. Since it has been four days, I suggest taking some antibiotics. I have amoxicillin at home, can I use that? Yes, you can use amoxicillin. Can you recommend some cold medicine for me to buy tonight? Yes, you can go buy some cold medicine tonight.",

The doctor also advised me to drink warm water, avoid cold and spicy foods, consume less sweets, ensure rest, avoid fatigue and exposure to cold, and maintain good ventilation in my living environment.

I took Clarithromycin, Azithromycin, and Compound Licorice Tablets before, but the doctor said these are not the preferred medications for treating pharyngitis, and doesn't recommend using Licorice Tablets.

My liver function is still good, but the ultrasound results suggest possible liver fibrosis. Overall, my condition is not important; what matters is whether I need antiviral treatment. The doctor suggested that I have a blood test to determine the level of liver fibrosis and undergo liver elasticity examination to assess the degree of fibrosis. Increased echogenicity, enhanced echoes, and widened portal veins are indicators of fibrosis level 2 and above, but I do not currently have liver cirrhosis. I just had a physical examination and I am not sure if it is necessary to undergo fibrosis examination now or wait until next year's examination. If liver fibrosis reaches level 2 or above, will treatment be required? Is there any way to treat liver fibrosis? The doctor mentioned checking again in six months, but a one-year follow-up seems quite long for me. Treatment for fibrosis should be started when fibrosis level 1 or higher is reached, and controlling the virus can also alleviate the degree of fibrosis. Additionally, medications such as Compound Turtleplastron Softening Liver Tablets can be taken to combat fibrosis. I would like to know what medications are needed for antiviral treatment.

I do not experience shortness of breath or chest tightness, but during severe coughing, I only feel right-sided chest pain accompanied by nausea with an inability to cough up phlegm. Since this recent illness, I have been frequently experiencing nasal congestion, but no other symptoms. The doctor mentioned that this is a manifestation of post-infection airway hyperresponsiveness, as the airways are quite sensitive. I asked the doctor if I need to go to the hospital for an X-ray and if I can take azithromycin, to which the doctor provided a medication plan and advised me to strictly follow it.

I would like to ask why I experience diarrhea immediately after eating. Currently, the only thing that does not cause diarrhea is drinking plain water. If I eat something else, such as having rice porridge in the morning, I would have diarrhea within ten minutes after eating, and as long as I don't eat anything, I won't have any further episodes of diarrhea. However, every time I eat something, after about ten minutes, I will experience diarrhea again. The stool sometimes appears watery, sometimes loose, sometimes yellow, and sometimes black. I do not experience stomach or gastric discomfort, and I also have no appetite during meals. I have been experiencing these symptoms for a year without any relief. I do not have diabetes or hyperthyroidism, and I have previously undergone minimally invasive surgery for kidney stones. I have visited the hospital, but the medications I have taken did not provide significant improvement. I am not sure about the specific medications I have taken.",

If symptoms of throat and nasal cavity occur at the same time, along with a cough, and there has been a history of staying up late and physical exhaustion, it is very likely that this is due to a weakened immune system caused by staying up late, leading to upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.

I am an adult and have been coughing for a long time, with a normal body temperature and no phlegm. The cough is dry. The chest X-ray shows a 2mm nodule, but the pulmonologist cannot identify any problems and the pulmonary function test is normal. I asked the doctor if hospitalization is necessary, and the doctor replied that small nodules generally do not cause coughing and hospitalization is not necessary. I can take oral medication with Baifule to treat it, and if the oral treatment is not effective, then hospitalization with intravenous therapy could be considered. I asked the doctor if it can be cured, and the doctor said it can be cured, but the nodules may not necessarily be related to Mycoplasma infection, so follow-up examinations are needed. I also asked the doctor about the effectiveness of azithromycin, and the doctor replied that azithromycin can also be used for treatment but there is a higher rate of drug resistance. The doctor suggested that I check the exhaled nitric oxide (NO) level, and I told the doctor that I have already done so and the results were normal. The doctor told me that Mycoplasma can cause dry cough and for now, it is important to treat the Mycoplasma infection. I mentioned that the exhaled NO result was slightly low, and the doctor said not to worry about it. I always thought that Mycoplasma would only cause fever, but it turns out that it is not always the case.",

After two days, on February 7th, I started taking cold-clearing and antipyretic capsules, but there was no significant improvement in my condition. I also started coughing up yellow phlegm. Yesterday, I went to the hospital and had some blood tests. The doctor said it's just a common inflammation and prescribed a medication called \"Baoding Disperse Tablet\" and \"Mushutang.\" However, this morning I started running a fever, which has lasted for a day with a temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius. Could it be a problem with the prescribed medication? My C-reactive protein level is very low and white blood cell count is slightly high. Does this mean it's a viral infection? According to my blood test results, it seems there is still a bacterial infection, possibly a result of low local respiratory resistance caused by a cold. The name \"Cefdinir\" on the prescription has a typo, but the medication itself shouldn't be a problem. The fever is likely caused by the infection. Should I continue taking Cefdinir and Mushutang? It seems that I feel better without taking them, but once I start taking them, I experience a low-grade fever. If you don't take the medication, you will still have a fever. There is also a cough syrup called \"Xiangxue Juhong Tan Jiaogan\" that I have been taking for three days, but it doesn't seem to be very effective. Can I continue taking it?",

However, I had severe diarrhea throughout the day. I took Enteritis Xiaoping tablets and Montmorillonite powder, and it has improved slightly.

I no longer have symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, acid reflux, belching, palpitations, chest tightness, dizziness, and headache.

In May, I started taking Chinese herbal medicine which worked well at first, but now after one month, the pain has returned. I feel like the food I eat is not being digested properly and my stomach peristalsis is slow. I also feel pain when I am hungry or when I eat indigestible foods such as peanuts or nuts. After the gastroscopy last year, the pain disappeared after two days of treatment, and I continued taking the medication for two weeks. But after that, I stopped taking it. The problem recurred in March this year, and now I am taking Chinese herbal medicine. The medicine initially had a good effect, but the pain has returned these past few days. It feels like my stomach is not digesting the food properly, and I have excessive gas, especially after lunch. Doing exercise, like swimming, helps alleviate the symptoms. I am not sure why this stomach issue is recurring and why it hasn't been fully cured despite taking medication.",

I scratched because it was very itchy, and the more I scratched, the redder it became, eventually developing into a mask face condition. I have been using erythromycin and chlorpheniramine for a month, and it was improving during the process, but then I switched to metronidazole gel and began taking compound glycyrrhizin tablets with chlorpheniramine. Two weeks ago, I felt that metronidazole was not very effective, so I consulted another doctor who advised me to use zinc oxide. However, I applied too much and the next day my entire face had a strong burning sensation and quickly became red and swollen. Then yesterday, after eating sturgeon soup, I felt very itchy in the evening. My face was slightly warm and had a prickling sensation, similar to prickly heat. The entire face was stinging. I rinsed with warm water and applied cold water. However, it still felt very dry, so I applied erythromycin for moisturizing. But after a while, the itching returned, with the prickling sensation of prickly heat all over the face. I woke up three times during the night, washed my face, and applied either vitamin E or erythromycin. Today, my face is still slightly red, warm, and itchy, especially sensitive to air conditioning.

I still experience stomach pain, including cramping. I feel fatigued overall. Last Monday, I had seafood with my husband, and the next day I had diarrhea, but he did not experience any problems. Since Tuesday, I haven't been eating much, mainly consuming rice porridge, vegetables, fruits, and coarse grains. I have also been avoiding oily foods. The weather has been changing a lot recently, so it's possible that I caught a cold. Previously, I rarely experienced discomfort or pain in my stomach and intestines. The doctor said it is likely that I have not fully recovered from acute gastroenteritis, and that the symptoms I am experiencing are a result of damaged gastrointestinal mucosa and disrupted gastrointestinal motility. They recommend conducting a stool test and a blood routine + gastrointestinal contrast examination to confirm. What about medication?",

However, I feel that it appears intermittently and not every day. I mentioned that it also goes away on its own after 2-3 days even without medication, as sometimes it improves immediately after taking medication, so I stopped taking it. The doctor once again confirmed that it is chronic urticaria, but not severe. The doctor asked if there were any triggers before each outbreak. I replied that I couldn't find any specific triggers myself. I asked the doctor if it could be related to staying up late, as I have been sleeping around 2-3 am recently. The doctor said there might be some connection, as staying up late can weaken the immune system and make it more susceptible to urticaria.

I had a medical examination at the disease control center half a month ago when I started working at the factory. I had a chest CT scan, which showed no obvious abnormalities.

If I don't experience any more episodes of coughing up blood in the future, what could be the cause of these symptoms? The doctor mentioned the possibility of pneumonia, and that the inflammation may be more severe. They suggested getting another CT scan since the previous one would be meaningless if there were no previous illnesses. I don't cough much, but isn't coughing a common symptom of pneumonia?",
