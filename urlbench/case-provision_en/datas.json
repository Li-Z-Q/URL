On December 3, 2011, the defendant borrowed 60,000 yuan from the plaintiff on the grounds of financial turnover. The plaintiff borrowed the money from someone else and gave it to the defendant, who promised to repay it quickly. However, the defendant has never repaid the loan and cannot be found. Therefore, the plaintiff brought the case to court and requested the following judgment: 1. The defendant shall repay the loan of 60,000 yuan; 2. The defendant shall bear the litigation costs and publication fees. The defendant, Bao Yinfang, did not appear in court, did not submit a written defense, and did not provide any evidence. To prove her claim, the plaintiff Yang Xiaoli submitted a promissory note to the court to demonstrate the fact that the defendant borrowed 60,000 yuan from her. After cross-examination, the court found that the promissory note submitted by the plaintiff is genuine and legally valid, which can prove the fact that the defendant borrowed money from her. The defendant, Bao Yinfang, did not present any cross-examination opinions or submit evidence, and therefore, is deemed to have waived the right to present evidence. After trial, the court made the following findings of fact: on December 3, 2011, the defendant Bao Yinfang issued a promissory note stating, \"I hereby borrow 600,000 yuan from Yang Xiaoli.\" Due to the defendant's failure to repay the loan, this case has caused a legal dispute.",

The signature of the debtor on the note is \"Wei Dagang\", but his ID card shows \"Wei Degang\". People in the same village also commonly refer to him as \"Wei Dagang\".

However, Li Dongyan couldn't contact Wei Degang afterwards, and Wei Degang still owes him 7000 yuan to this day. Therefore, Li Dongyan filed a lawsuit and demanded that Wei Degang pay the outstanding motorcycle payment and interest. Li Dongyan provided a promissory note as evidence to prove the fact and amount of Wei Degang's debt. Wei Degang did not appear in court.

After the court served the documents, Wei Degang contacted Li Dongyan and paid back 3000 yuan, leaving a remaining balance of 7000 yuan. The evidence provided by Li Dongyan is authentic and can prove the fact that Wei Degang purchased the motorcycle without paying. This court confirms the above facts.",

Order the defendant to bear the litigation costs. The facts and reasons are as follows: In the second half of 2015, the plaintiff sold straw to the defendant's sheep farm for sheep feed. After settlement, the defendant owed the plaintiff 40,800 yuan. As the defendant did not make the payment, he used 800 yuan worth of lamb meat as partial payment and also wrote an IOU for the remaining 40,000 yuan on the spot (see IOU dated February 4, 2016). The parties orally agreed to settle the debt on the tenth day of the first month of the lunar new year. However, the defendant failed to repay despite several reminders, hence the plaintiff's lawsuit to the court. The defendant Li Jun and Sui Ning Longxi Sheep Professional Cooperative did not appear in court and did not submit a written defense or any evidence. The plaintiff submitted evidence including the IOU and a copy of defendant Li Jun's identity card, which the defendant did not challenge. After reviewing and confirming the submitted evidence, this court ascertains the following facts: In the second half of 2015, the defendant Li Jun purchased straw (peanut sprouts, peanut shells, soybean stalks) from the plaintiff Xu Xingke for his sheep farming needs. On February 4, 2016, after settlement, the defendant still owed the plaintiff 40,000 yuan for the straw purchase, and provided the plaintiff with an IOU. Despite multiple reminders, the defendant failed to make the payment, leading to the plaintiff's lawsuit to the court.",

The defendant has been holding the card and without reason, used it to swipe the plaintiff's cash, resulting in significant loss and damage to the plaintiff's credit at the bank. The plaintiff has made multiple attempts to ask the defendant to return the credit card and money, but without success. Therefore, the plaintiff requests the court to: 1) Order the defendant to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of 21,000 yuan plus interest in accordance with the law, and 2) Require the defendant to bear the litigation costs. The defendant, Liu Jianwei, did not provide a defense. According to the plaintiff's lawsuit, this court summarizes the dispute in this case as: whether the plaintiff's claims have factual and legal basis. The evidence submitted by plaintiff An Daofeng to this court includes: 1) One IOU, which proves the defendant's indebtedness to the plaintiff in the amount of 21,000 yuan for using the plaintiff's credit card. 2) One bank statement, which proves the defendant's use of the plaintiff's credit card for purchases. The defendant Liu Jianwei did not submit evidence to this court. The defendant, Liu Jianwei, did not appear in court, which is deemed as forfeiting the right to cross-examine the evidence. The evidence submitted by the plaintiff is relevant to the facts of the case and truthfully reflects the defendant's use of the plaintiff's credit card and the subsequent issuance of an IOU, confirming the existence of a creditor-debtor relationship. Therefore, the above evidence can serve as a basis for the judgment in this case. Through the trial, it is ascertained by this court that the following facts can be confirmed: In September 2016, based on the plaintiff's house purchase, the defendant, Liu Jianwei, held the plaintiff's credit card from Construction Bank. During this period, the defendant used the card for consumption. On January 26, 2017, the defendant Liu Jianwei issued an IOU to the plaintiff for 21,000 yuan.",

On June 26, 2014, the plaintiff and the defendant reconciled their accounts and as of May 31, 2014, the defendant still owed the plaintiff RMB 41,428.67 in processing fees. The plaintiff has made multiple attempts to contact the defendant for payment, but the defendant has refused to pay. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit seeking a court order for the defendant to pay the plaintiff RMB 41,428.67 in processing fees, as well as interest calculated at the bank's current loan rate from April 1, 2014, until the judgment is enforced. The defendant, Shanghai Deli Industry and Trade Co., Ltd., argued that there is no dispute regarding the contractual relationship, delivery facts, and amount owed claimed by the plaintiff. The reason for not paying is that the plaintiff delayed the delivery of the last batch of goods. The plaintiff promised to deliver the goods within 48 hours after the order was placed, but the plaintiff did not deliver until February 12, 2014, after the defendant placed the order on January 24, 2014, resulting in significant economic losses for the defendant. To substantiate its claims, the plaintiff submitted evidence to the court, including delivery notes, corresponding VAT invoices, and a confirmation letter of account reconciliation for the period from December 2013 to February 2014. The defendant did not contest the authenticity of the evidence presented by the plaintiff during the court questioning. Based on the submitted evidence and the oral statements of both parties, the court confirms that as of February 12, 2014, the defendant owes the plaintiff RMB 41,428.67 in processing fees.",

To prove their claim, the plaintiff has submitted a promissory note to the court, which verifies that the defendant borrowed RMB 20,000.00 from them. The defendant argues that they do not owe any money to the plaintiff, Liu Baolei, as they are not friends. They claim that the money was lent to them by Qiao Wen through Liu Baolei for gambling debts, and the promissory note was reluctantly signed. After hearing and examining the evidence, it is found that on February 16, 2015, the defendant, Sun Wei, borrowed RMB 20,000.00 from the plaintiff, Liu Baolei, and issued a promissory note. The defendant has failed to repay this amount. The plaintiff now sues and demands that the defendant, Sun Wei, repay the borrowed amount of RMB 20,000.00, and any associated interest.",

When the car was traveling from east to west at the Zhangba Bridge intersection on the Pingshi Expressway, it collided with Yang, who was riding a bicycle across the road from south to north, resulting in injuries to Yang and damage to the vehicle. After the accident, the defendant Lei immediately got off the car to rescue the victim, while Li, who was in the car, made emergency calls to the police and 120 for medical assistance. Despite receiving medical treatment at the hospital, Yang did not survive. The Baofeng County Public Security Traffic Police Brigade arrived at the scene of the accident and took Lei back for questioning. Lei truthfully confessed to the crime. The Baofeng County Public Security Traffic Police Brigade determined that Lei was primarily responsible for the accident, while Yang bore secondary responsibility. The vehicle involved in the accident, a Toyota small ordinary passenger car with Beijing license plate number ×××××, was insured with compulsory insurance and third-party liability insurance. Apart from the compensation for losses that the victim's close relatives are entitled to through litigation, Lei's family members agreed to provide a one-time compensation of 65,000 yuan to the victim's close relatives, forgiving Lei for his actions. The above facts were undisputed by the defendant Lei during the court hearing, and were supported by testimonies from witnesses Li, Yang 1, and Yang 2, as well as expert opinions, household registration certificates, criminal records certificates, driver's license, vehicle registration copy, driving qualifications, motor vehicle information query, victim's identity information, accident determination report, breakthrough and arrest process, agreement, forgiveness letter, and other evidence.

The plaintiff has now brought the case to court and requests the following judgment: 1) the defendant to repay the loan of 30,000.00 yuan along with the interest calculated up until the actual payment date; 2) the defendant to bear the litigation costs. The evidence submitted by the plaintiff includes text messages, which prove the existence of the debt, the exact amount, and the repayment deadline agreed upon with the defendant. The defendant argues that the plaintiff, the defendant, and Yang Moumou are all friends. On May 15, 2013, the defendant borrowed 30,000.00 yuan from the plaintiff and immediately handed over the borrowed amount to Yang Haiyan. The defendant claims that the plaintiff should assert its rights against Yang Haiyan. The defendant requests the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit. The evidence submitted by the defendant includes a bank deposit receipt, which proves the fact of repayment to Yang Moumou. During the court hearing, the defendant does not recognize the evidence provided by the plaintiff, claiming it does not prove that the phone from which the text messages were sent belongs to Su Tianying. The plaintiff also does not recognize the evidence provided by the defendant, arguing that the repayment to Yang Moumou is unrelated to this case.",

After verification, it was found that the defendant still owes the plaintiff 4500 yuan in wages for October to December 2011. Therefore, the plaintiff requests that the court order the defendant to pay the plaintiff 4500 yuan in wages. To prove the facts of their claim, the plaintiff has provided the court with a certificate from the Qiangtou Town Human Resources and Social Security Service Center in Xiangshan County, as well as a wage list from Xiangshan Shengdan Garment Factory, both of which attest to the facts that the factory is not registered and that the defendant still owes the plaintiff 4500 yuan in wages. The defendant, Dan Dan, did not respond or provide any defense evidence.

Article 2 of the \"Agreement\" stated that both parties agreed that their current joint property was worth 480,000 yuan, with the woman receiving 240,000 yuan.

It was also stated in the agreement that if the man, Cai, failed to pay the remaining amount on time, he would bear legal responsibility. In January 2010, the plaintiff demanded the second installment from the defendant, who refused to pay, claiming financial difficulty, and requested a postponement until the first half of the year.

They agreed to repay the loan within three months, with a monthly interest rate of 1%. After the loan matured, the plaintiff made multiple unsuccessful attempts to demand repayment. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting: 1) the defendant to repay the plaintiff the loan amount of 140,000 yuan and the interest (calculated at a monthly interest rate of 1% from the date of the loan until the actual repayment); 2) the defendant to bear the litigation costs. Guo Shijun failed to submit a defense. After trial, it was determined that on March 3, 2014, the defendant Guo Shijun borrowed 140,000 yuan from the plaintiff Wang Cuiping and issued a promissory note. The promissory note stated that the plaintiff borrowed a total of 140,000 yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 1%, and specified that it should be repaid within three months. After the loan matured, the plaintiff made multiple unsuccessful attempts to demand repayment, leading to the litigation. The above facts are supported by the identification cards of the plaintiff and defendant, a copy of the promissory note, the statements of the parties involved, and the court trial transcript, which are sufficient for confirmation.",

Request the court to order the defendant to immediately repay the loan principal of 20,000 yuan and interest of 5,100 yuan, totaling 25,100 yuan. The interest should be calculated at a monthly interest rate of 1.5% from November 7, 2016, until the debt is fully repaid. 2. Request the defendant to bear the litigation costs. Facts and Reasons: On June 19, 2015, the defendant, Liu Desheng, borrowed 20,000 yuan from me. It was agreed that the monthly interest would be calculated at 1.5%, and the repayment deadline would be October 2016. Leichunbao, the defendant, provided guarantees. After the loan became overdue, I repeatedly demanded repayment from the defendant, who has been delaying payment on the grounds of no money. I have therefore filed a lawsuit with the court. The defendants, Liu Desheng and Leichunbao, failed to respond to the complaint. After trial, the court found the following facts: The plaintiff provided an original promissory note signed by the borrower Liu Desheng and guarantor Leichunbao, stating that Liu Desheng owed 20,000 RMB to Ji Fengjie, with a monthly interest of 1.5%, to be repaid in full by October 2016. This document is legally obtained, the content is true and trustworthy, and it can reflect the true situation of the case. It can be determined that the defendant Liu Desheng borrowed 20,000 yuan from the plaintiff with a monthly interest rate of 15‰, to be repaid before October 2016, and the guarantor is the defendant Leichunbao, without specifying the guarantee method. As of November 19, 2016, the loan has been overdue for 17 months, resulting in interest of 5,100 yuan (20,000 yuan principal × monthly interest rate of 15‰ × 17 months).",

Song Tieshan issued promissory notes and promised to repay the loan by the end of February 2017. Despite repeated demands from the plaintiff, the defendant has not repaid the loan, hence the lawsuit. The defendant Song Tieshan has not responded to the complaint. Both parties have provided evidence in accordance with the litigation request, and the defendant's failure to appear in court and cross-examine the evidence is considered a waiver of the right to cross-examine.

Due to a lack of understanding and a weak emotional foundation, the couple lived apart for many years. Our personalities clashed, and the marriage completely broke down. Reconciliation is not possible, and continuing to live together has no meaning. I now file a lawsuit requesting the court to grant a divorce. Plaintiff Sun has submitted the following evidence to the court to prove the above claims: 1. Copy of plaintiff's ID card and the plaintiff's and defendant's household registration cards, proving the identities of the involved parties; 2. Copy of the marriage certificate, proving the registration of the marriage between the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant, Li, did not provide a written defense and did not present any evidence during the period of presenting evidence. Based on the evidence provided by the plaintiff and the statements made during the trial, this court confirms the following facts: In March 2011, the plaintiff Sun and the defendant Li met through a mutual acquaintance. On October 8, 2011, they registered their marriage at the Civil Affairs Bureau in Qimen County, Anhui Province. The couple did not have any children. In the early stages of the marriage, the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant was still acceptable. However, they started having arguments over trivial matters shortly after getting married. In July 2013, they began living separately. At the end of 2013, the plaintiff Sun previously filed a lawsuit in court, but later withdrew it. On November 3, 2014, the plaintiff Sun filed another lawsuit in this court, requesting the following judgments: 1. Grant a divorce from the defendant; 2. The plaintiff bears the litigation costs.",

Instruct the defendant to immediately return the loan of 320,000 yuan and pay interest at an annual rate of 6% from the date of the lawsuit until the loan is fully repaid. 2. The defendant should bear the litigation costs. The facts and reasons are as follows: In 2012, the plaintiff loaned 320,000 yuan to Wang Tongzhi with a 2% interest agreement. Wang Tongzhi then lent this amount to Fan Naixue. On August 28, 2016, after negotiation among the plaintiff, Wang Tongzhi, and the defendant Fan Naixue, the defendant issued a promissory note to the plaintiff and assumed the repayment obligation. However, despite multiple requests from the plaintiff, the defendant refused to return the loan. Fan Naixue argued that he did not know the plaintiff and did not borrow money from him. He claimed ignorance of whether the plaintiff delivered the money to a third party or whether the third party gave the money to the defendant for use. He asserted that there was no creditor-debtor relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, and therefore the defendant should not bear the responsibility for repayment. The promissory note issued by the defendant on behalf of the plaintiff was made under duress, as the defendant was surrounded by more than ten individuals including the plaintiff and the third party. It does not represent the true intention of the defendant and cannot be used as evidence in the case. The defendant requested the rejection of the plaintiff's lawsuit. Wang Tongzhi stated that the plaintiff's claim is true and the defendant's defense is false. He confirmed that the disputed amount was directly transferred to the defendant's account.

Defendants Zhao Shengli and Yang Guiying borrowed 100,000 yuan from the plaintiff Yang Ailian, with Zhao Qiaodan as the guarantor, and the loan was to be fully repaid by April 3, 2013. The loan agreement also stipulated that if the full loan is not repaid by the due date, the borrower shall bear a penalty of 10% of the total loan amount per day.

The defendant argues that the plaintiff's claim for the unpaid motorcycle payment is true, but the plaintiff has not provided a purchase invoice and a vehicle certificate, thus the motorcycle cannot be registered. If the plaintiff provides the purchase invoice and vehicle certificate to the defendant, the defendant is willing to pay for the vehicle. After investigation, it was confirmed that on August 18, 2012, the defendant Yang Guowei purchased one Wuyang Honda 125-S curved-beam motorcycle from the plaintiff for a price of 6600 yuan. Subsequently, the defendant installed one pair of foot pedals and one folder, and owed 3420 yuan after paying part of the vehicle price. The defendant issued an IOU to the plaintiff, stating: \"IOU, currently owes Wang Zhenlong in cash RMB (in Chinese characters) three thousand four hundred and twenty yuan, ¥3420, debt incurred on August 18, 2012, debtor Yang Guowei, repayment due on September 31, 2012.\" The plaintiff made multiple attempts to collect the debt from the defendant but was unsuccessful. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay the outstanding motorcycle payment of 3420 yuan and bear the litigation costs. The above facts are confirmed by the IOU, vehicle certificate, statements from the plaintiff and the defendant, as well as the court hearing transcript.",

Order the defendant to bear the litigation costs of this case. Facts and reasons: In early 2014, the defendant Wuyan Shopping Mall held a staff meeting, proclaiming that the company was expanding its business and borrowing money from employees and their relatives, with an annual interest rate of 20%, no specific repayment deadline, and the option to repay the principal and interest at any time. Upon the introduction of a friend, the plaintiff loaned 100,000 yuan to the defendant on April 23, 2014, and the defendant issued a receipt. However, the defendant only repaid 5,000 yuan in January 2016, 50,000 yuan in July 2016, and 7,000 yuan in January 2017 as interest. There is still an outstanding principal of 100,000 yuan and interest. Despite multiple reminders from the plaintiff, the defendant ignored the requests. To protect the plaintiff's legitimate rights and interests, the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting the court to support the plaintiff's claims. The defendant, Wuyan Shopping Mall, argued that the loan is valid but has already repaid 19,000 yuan of the principal, and the remaining principal and interest should be calculated accordingly.

The defendants, Mr. Wu and Ms. Gan, were duly summoned by the court but refused to appear without justifiable reasons. Mr. Xu, the plaintiff, claimed that Mr. Wu borrowed 150,000 yuan from him on October 17, 2009, and provided a loan agreement as evidence. Despite several reminders from the plaintiff, the defendants failed to repay the loan. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit requesting joint repayment of the loan amount by Mr. Wu and Ms. Gan. During the litigation, the plaintiff waived the lawsuit against Ms. Gan. Both defendants, Mr. Wu and Ms. Gan, neither entered a defense nor submitted relevant evidence to the court within the specified deadline. After trial, the court found that the established facts were consistent with the facts stated by the plaintiff. The facts were confirmed by the loan agreement original provided by Mr. Wu and other evidence presented by Mr. Xu and his witness. The defendants' refusal to appear in court after being lawfully summoned is considered a waiver of their right to cross-examine and defend. After examination, the court found that the plaintiff's evidence was legally obtained and authentic, and had relevance to the facts in question.

The aforementioned facts were neither objected by the defendant during the trial nor disputed by other witnesses such as Yao A, Yao B, Yan, and others. The evidence, including on-site investigation records, blood alcohol content forensic examination report, criminal photographs, forensic autopsy examination opinion, household registration certificate, previous criminal record certificate, arrest certificate, case-solving process, compensation agreement, and payment receipts, is sufficient for confirmation.",

However, the defendant has been refusing to repay the loan. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit to protect his legitimate rights and interests, seeking: 1. The court orders the defendant to repay the plaintiff the loan of 44,000 yuan; 2. The defendant bears the litigation costs. The plaintiff provides two promissory notes to prove his claim and the existence of a loan relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. The defendant, Sun Yong, argues that the plaintiff's description of the relationship between the parties is true. The defendant did borrow 44,000 yuan from the plaintiff, but the defendant has already repaid 10,000 yuan. The 10,000 yuan that the plaintiff claims was taken by a third party, Sun Shiquan, for job search activities has nothing to do with the defendant. In summary, the defendant requests the court to make a ruling according to the law. The defendant, in response to his claim, did not provide any evidence. After trial, it was found that the plaintiff and the defendant have a friendship relationship.

The plaintiff paid the loan amount to the defendants in cash and the defendants issued a promissory note to the plaintiff. However, the defendants failed to pay the interest on time as agreed, and the plaintiff has repeatedly demanded repayment of the loan principal and interest from the defendants, but they have continuously evaded and refused to fulfill their obligations. Wu Hanjiang and Wu Xuankun have not submitted a defense. After reviewing the evidence, this court determines the following facts: On June 13, 2016, the defendant Wu Hanjiang issued a promissory note to the plaintiff Huo Qingxiang, stating that he borrowed RMB 15,000 in cash, with a repayment date set on January 30, 2017, and monthly interest of RMB 150.",

The defendant, Mr. He, did not respond to the complaint and did not submit any evidence to the court within the specified time for evidence submission. Upon trial, it was determined that the plaintiff and the defendant started cohabiting after being introduced by someone, and they had their first child, Mr. He A, on June 23, 2005, and their second child, Mr. He B, on October 24, 2010. The couple registered their marriage on February 1, 2010. After marriage, the plaintiff and the defendant had arguments over trivial matters, leading to conflicts between them. The plaintiff now sues for divorce on the grounds that the marital relationship has broken down. The above facts are confirmed by the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, including the plaintiff's ID card, household registration proof letter, household registration book with Mr. He Quan as the head of the household, marriage certificate, birth medical certificate, and the plaintiff's statement in court, which have been examined and verified by the court.",

On April 1, 2012, the defendant borrowed 500,000 yuan from the plaintiff due to difficulties in business turnover and issued a promissory note with his own signature to the plaintiff. The parties agreed that if the plaintiff needs to recover the loan, the defendant must unconditionally repay it with one month's notice. The plaintiff has repeatedly pursued the defendant for repayment, but the defendant has refused to repay the loan each time for various reasons. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit and requested the court to order the defendant to repay the loan of 500,000 yuan and its interest. The interest is calculated based on the loan amount of 500,000 yuan, starting from the date of the lawsuit on September 27, 2013, according to the benchmark interest rate for similar loans of the People's Bank of China until the date of full payment. The defendant did not appear in court and did not provide a written defense. The plaintiff provided a promissory note to the court as evidence of their claim. In the lawsuit, the plaintiff guarantees the authenticity of the evidence provided and the statements made, and is willing to bear corresponding legal responsibilities. Due to the lack of contradictory evidence to refute the plaintiff's evidence and the absence of factors affecting the evidential force, and considering the plaintiff's guarantee of authenticity, this court has verified and confirmed the following facts: On April 1, 2012, the defendant borrowed 500,000 yuan from the plaintiff due to financial difficulties and issued a promissory note, which was acknowledged by the plaintiff. The parties did not agree on the loan term and interest rate, but agreed that if the plaintiff needs to recover the loan, the defendant must unconditionally repay it with one month's notice. After the plaintiff urged for repayment, the defendant has not paid any amount to the plaintiff until now, and the plaintiff's pursuit has been unsuccessful, resulting in this lawsuit.",

The plaintiff's attempts to recover the debt were unsuccessful, hence the lawsuit to request the court to order the defendant to immediately pay the plaintiff the sum of 189,653 yuan. The defendant Zhang Huici did not provide a defense. To substantiate the plaintiff's claim, a settlement statement was submitted to the court, proving that as of August 21, 2012, the defendant owed the plaintiff 198,953 yuan, which was not paid. The defendant Zhang Huici did not submit any evidence to the court. The defendant Zhang Huici was lawfully summoned by the court to present evidence but did not appear without justifiable reason, thereby waiving the right to present evidence and cross-examine. After examination, the court found that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff conforms to the authenticity, legitimacy, and relevance of evidence, and can prove the facts of the case, thus the court made a determination. Based on the accepted evidence and the plaintiff's statements, it is established that starting from March 26, 2012, the defendant Zhang Huici purchased cloth from the plaintiff. On August 21, 2012, after a settlement between the original parties, the defendant owed the plaintiff a sum of 198,953 yuan, which was confirmed by the defendant's signature. On August 25, 2012, the defendant paid 9,800 yuan, leaving a remaining debt of 189,153 yuan. Due to unsuccessful attempts to collect the debt, the dispute has escalated into litigation.",

Since October 2015, the parties have been living separately. During this period, the defendant made no effort to restore the relationship, and the marital bond has completely broken. The plaintiff therefore sues the court, requesting a legal judgement to grant divorce between the parties, as well as the division of marital property and shared debts according to the law. Defendant Li argues that we can continue living together, and that the marital bond has not broken. I do not agree to a divorce.

Since December 2013, the couple has been living separately. The plaintiff requests the court to legally grant the divorce, divide the marital property according to the law, and have the defendant bear the litigation costs. The defendant Mao argues that the plaintiff's allegations of gambling addiction and domestic violence are false. The plaintiff's request for divorce is because the defendant used to work outside and earn money. However, in 2012, the defendant suffered from a sudden cerebral hemorrhage and has since lost most of his/her ability to work. The defendant believes that there is no conflict between the parties and that the marital relationship has not been broken. The defendant does not agree to the divorce. After trial, it is found that the plaintiff Shen and defendant Mao met in April of 1988 according to rural customs and held a wedding ceremony, living together as husband and wife. The couple gave birth to a son, Mao Yuanxi, on [date]. The marital relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant was initially acceptable, but in recent years, conflicts have arisen due to trivial matters, leading to an estranged relationship. The plaintiff then filed a lawsuit requesting the court to rule as requested. The above facts have been confirmed by evidence such as the residence registration card, the proof from Panyi Town Committee in Sheyang County, and the statements of the parties.

The plaintiff purchased a property located at Building B15, 3rd floor, No. 10, Yunzhong Road, Yuquan District, with a total area of 53.04 square meters. The price per square meter was 6,722.8 yuan, and the total price was 356,577 yuan. After the contract was signed, the plaintiff paid the down payment of 186,577 yuan to the defendant on January 22, 2013. However, the defendant has yet to deliver the property.

The defendant Zhu Jun did not appear in court and did not defend himself. After trial and investigation, it is confirmed that the defendant borrowed money from the plaintiff in three installments due to the urgent need for funds. On April 2, 2014, 62,000 yuan was borrowed in cash; on April 12, 2014, 50,000 yuan was borrowed in cash; and on May 22, 2014, 180,000 yuan was borrowed through bank transfer and cash. The total principal amount of these loans is 292,000 yuan. The defendant issued three loan notes to the plaintiff.

Facts and reasons: The plaintiff and the defendant have a friendship. Due to financial difficulties, the defendant urgently needed money and borrowed a total of 100,000 yuan from the plaintiff on January 20 and 24, 2017. On January 20, 2017, the plaintiff paid the defendant 50,000 yuan in cash, and on January 24, the plaintiff transferred 50,000 yuan to the defendant's account at the China Industrial and Commercial Bank on Chenglin Road, Haidong District. The defendant provided loan notes and signed a promise to repay by the end of February. After the loan became due, the plaintiff requested repayment from the defendant, but the defendant repeatedly delayed, so the plaintiff filed a lawsuit. Wu Guocai argued that what the plaintiff stated is factual, and the defendant agreed to repay the plaintiff's loan of 100,000 yuan. However, the defendant still owes money to others and currently has no repayment ability. The defendant's wages have been fully frozen by the court, and the defendant has no other sources of income. The plaintiff and the defendant were classmates. At that time, the defendant borrowed money from the plaintiff for medical treatment and to repay other loans. Once the defendant's leg improves, he can work and earn money, or borrow money from other friends, and can repay the plaintiff within three years. This court has determined the following facts after deliberation: the plaintiff and the defendant are classmates, and the defendant borrowed money from the plaintiff due to medical treatment and other reasons. On January 20, 2017, the plaintiff gave the defendant 50,000 yuan in cash. On January 24, 2017, the plaintiff transferred 50,000 yuan to the defendant's account through his husband Chen Deshun's Industrial and Commercial Bank account, and provided a \"loan note\".",

However, due to differences in their life philosophies, habits, personalities, career aspirations, investment ideas, personal hobbies, and the dominant presence of the defendant's family, the plaintiff has been living in repression for a long time. Despite enduring and accommodating, harmony in the family has not been achieved. In July 2014, the plaintiff and defendant separated and the marital relationship has completely broken down. Therefore, the plaintiff requests a divorce and custody of the child. The defendant, Mrs. B, argues that the marital relationship between the plaintiff and defendant has not broken down and disagrees with the divorce. The statements in the plaintiff's complaint are not accurate, and the conflicts between the plaintiff and defendant have not reached the level of dissolution of the marriage. After receiving the complaint, the defendant has also reflected and is willing to improve her shortcomings, striving for reconciliation. After hearing the case, it is found that in May 2005, the plaintiff and defendant met online and established a romantic relationship in September of the same year. They registered their marriage on a date in 2006. On a date in 2011, they gave birth to a son, named Mr. C. After marriage, the plaintiff and defendant lived in a house purchased by the defendant, and their marital relationship was good for a period of time. They also purchased a property in a city in Jiangsu Province. However, due to the fact that the plaintiff and defendant lived in the house prepared by the defendant after marriage, and the defendant's family had better financial conditions than the plaintiff, combined with the pressure from the plaintiff's work, the plaintiff felt great pressure in life and was emotionally suppressed. In July 2014, the plaintiff left home and rented a house, and the couple has been separated since then. During the trial, the plaintiff insisted on getting a divorce, while the defendant opposed it, resulting in unsuccessful mediation. The above facts are supported by the marriage registration excerpt, residency proof, and court hearing transcript, and the facts are clear and the evidence is valid.",

Request the defendant to bear the litigation costs. Facts and reasons: On March 26, 2012, the defendant signed a \"Maximum Guarantee Agricultural Household Small Loans Contract\" with the plaintiff, borrowing 50,000 yuan, with Ouyang Jinsong assuming joint guarantee liability. After the loan matured, the defendant failed to repay the loan. Despite multiple demands from the plaintiff, the defendant did not fulfill the repayment, hence the lawsuit filed to the court. The defendant did not appear in court or submit a written defense. Based on the statements from the parties and the examined evidence, this court determines the following facts: On March 26, 2012, the defendant, based on business purposes, signed a \"China Agricultural Bank Agricultural Household Loan Contract\" with the plaintiff, which stipulated the revolving credit limit of 50,000 yuan, valid from March 26, 2012, to March 25, 2015, and other contents. Ouyang Jinsong, as the guarantor, signed in the guarantee section of the loan contract. On the same day, the plaintiff transferred the loan amount of 50,000 yuan to the defendant's bank account as agreed. Subsequently, the defendant has consistently failed to repay the loan principal and interest in accordance with the agreement, therefore the plaintiff has sued the defendant, Zhu Chungeng, and guarantor Ouyang Jinsong to this court. During the trial, Ouyang Jinsong repaid the outstanding principal of 48,747.89 yuan on August 21, 2017, and with the permission of this court, the plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit against Ouyang Jinsong. Thus, the defendant still owes interest of 11,326.10 yuan.",

The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendants. The facts and reasons are as follows: In August 2014, the defendant Sun contracted the carpentry and exterior scaffolding work of the defendant Zhao's building construction. In the same month, the defendant Sun asked the plaintiff to work at the construction site with a daily wage of 260 yuan. After the project was completed, the defendant Sun did not pay the plaintiff's wages, leaving an outstanding artificial fee of 30,160 yuan. The plaintiff believes that the defendant Zhao subcontracted the carpentry and exterior scaffolding of his construction project to the defendant Sun, and therefore the defendant Zhao should bear responsibility within the scope of unpaid construction fees. The plaintiff now initiates a lawsuit against the defendants. The defendants Sun and Zhao did not submit a defense. After examining the evidence, this court concludes the following facts: The plaintiff Wang claims that the defendant Sun contracted the carpentry and exterior scaffolding work of the defendant Zhao's building construction. In September 2014, the plaintiff Wang worked as a carpenter at the construction site contracted by the defendant Sun and was only partially paid for his labor. On November 2, 2014, after settling with the defendant Sun, the plaintiff Wang is still owed an artificial fee of 30,160 yuan, for which the defendant Sun issued an IOU to the plaintiff. As for the plaintiff's claim for interest, it shall be calculated from the date of filing the lawsuit at the benchmark interest rate for bank loans set by the People's Bank of China.",

Through contact with Tan Hongquan, I went to work at the defendant's construction site. We agreed on a daily wage of 180 yuan. After the completion of the project, the defendant should have paid me a total of 4000 yuan in wages. However, at that time, the defendant was unable to settle the total project payment and could only provide me with transportation expenses to return home. After repeated urging from me, the defendant paid me 1200 yuan on January 18, 2014, but still owes me 2800 yuan. Subsequently, the defendant always refused to pay me the remaining wages, using the excuse of not having money. In order to protect my legitimate rights and interests, I have filed a lawsuit with the People's Court, requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay me 2800 yuan in wages. The defendant Wang XX did not appear in court to defend, nor did he provide evidence to the court. After trial, the following facts have been established: Plaintiff Sheng XX started working at the defendant Wang XX's construction site in September 2013. After the completion of the project, the defendant owed the plaintiff 4000 yuan in wages and issued a promissory note to the plaintiff on October 11, 2013, stating that the defendant would fully settle the debt within two months.

Request the defendant to pay the interest calculated at an annual interest rate of 10.98% from April 25, 2005 until fully repaid; 3. Request the defendant to bear the litigation costs. The facts and reasons are as follows: The plaintiff and the defendant are neighbors. On April 25, 2005, the defendant borrowed 50,000 yuan from the plaintiff, and it was agreed that the defendant would pay interest. The plaintiff has repeatedly urged the defendant to repay the loan to no avail, and therefore requests a legal judgment to protect their lawful rights. Liu Xibi did not appear in court and did not submit a written defense. After trial, this court ascertained the following facts: The plaintiff and the defendant are neighbors. On April 25, 2005, the defendant borrowed 50,000 yuan from the plaintiff. Because the plaintiff did not have the money at the time, the plaintiff borrowed 50,000 yuan in cash from Chongqing Rural Commercial Bank and lent it to the defendant. The loan carried an annual interest rate of 10.98%. At the same time, the defendant issued a promissory note to the plaintiff, which stated: \"Received 50,000 yuan in cash from Luo Jinkang today, this amount is a loan, and the interest generated will be borne by me. Borrower: Liu Xibi, April 25, 2005.\" The plaintiff has repeatedly urged the defendant to repay the loan to no avail, and filed a lawsuit requesting a judgment. The above facts, in addition to the plaintiff's oral statement in court, are supported by the following evidence provided by the plaintiff: 1. Copy of the plaintiff's identity card; 2. Copy of the defendant's identity information; 3. Original promissory note; 4. Two loan vouchers. The above evidence is objectively true and mutually supportive, and this court accepts and confirms the facts supported by it.",

Unable to tolerate the situation any longer, I have decided to sue and request a divorce from the defendant, Mr. Xi.\n\nThe defendant argues that it is true that he drinks alcohol, which he admits, but he claims that I, Ms. Jin, have also physically assaulted him and verbally abused him. The debts, which amount to over 100,000 yuan, were borrowed by both of us, so if a divorce is granted, I, Ms. Jin, should be responsible for repaying half of the debts. Furthermore, during our marriage, I, Ms. Jin, had a cohabitation relationship with Mr. Hai from Ao Bao Ai Li, and we even have a photo together as evidence.\n\nAfter conducting a trial, it has been established that the plaintiff and defendant married on April 23, 2012, through a mutual acquaintance. Ms. Jin was previously married and has no children. During the marriage, they jointly purchased a four-wheeler and a motorcycle.

It was agreed that the monthly interest rate would be 1.2%, and the debt, along with the interest, would be repaid by the end of December 2013. Despite multiple reminders from the plaintiff, the defendant refused to repay the debt, citing various reasons. In order to protect the plaintiff's legal rights and interests, the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit requesting the court to order the defendant to repay the fertilizer debt of 7600.00 RMB and the interest (computed from April 13, 2013, until the repayment date).

Facts and reasons: The defendant Xu Xiaoxue had borrowed money from the plaintiff Lu Xiaoqiao. On July 31, 2016, after settlement, the defendant Xu Xiaoxue still owed the plaintiff Lu Xiaoqiao 30,000 yuan, with a loan term of 20 days and interest calculated at a monthly rate of 2%. The defendant Xu Xiaoxue personally issued a promissory note. After the loan, the plaintiff repeatedly urged the defendant to repay, but the defendant has not done so to this day. Therefore, the plaintiff filed this lawsuit with the court. The defendant Xu Xiaoxue did not provide a defense. To prove the facts claimed in the lawsuit, the plaintiff submitted a promissory note to the court as evidence of the loan. Regarding the evidence provided by the plaintiff, the defendant Xu Xiaoxue, having been lawfully summoned by the court, failed to appear in court without justified reasons, which is considered as a waiver of the right to cross-examine and defend. After examination, the court found that the evidence submitted by the plaintiff meets the requirements of the \"three characteristics\" of evidence and confirms its probative value in accordance with the law.

Instruct the defendant to pay interest on the arrears at the current People's Bank of China loan benchmark interest rate from the date of the debt until the date of full payment; 3. Require the defendant to bear all litigation costs in this case. \n\nFacts and reasons: In October 2014, the defendant, under the name of borrowing from Wuhan Tingyu Construction Co., Ltd., undertook the construction of the bridge project for the JinYinhu Water System Connection Project Sections 2 and 3 in Dongxihu District, Wuhan City. During the construction process, the defendant verbally invited the plaintiff to participate in the project as a partner in investment management, with a 50% partnership stake in the project. As a result, the plaintiff accumulated a total of RMB 1,490,000 in actual investment in the project and participated in its early-stage management and construction. During the partnership period, the defendant, in violation of the partnership agreement, improperly used the partnership construction funds, rendering it impossible for the partnership between the plaintiff and the defendant to continue. After negotiation between the parties, the plaintiff withdrew from the partnership, and the defendant confirmed and agreed to pay the plaintiff the RMB 1,490,000 paid by the plaintiff during the partnership period within three months, issuing the plaintiff a promissory note on June 1, 2015. Since September 2015, despite repeated requests for payment by the plaintiff, the defendant has been delaying payment. Therefore, the plaintiff hereby brings a lawsuit to the court and requests a lawful judgment. \n\nThe defendant, Cao Guoxiong, has not submitted any defense opinions to the court, nor has the defendant submitted any corresponding evidence. Regarding the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, the court, after examining the original evidence presented by the plaintiff in court, lawfully accepts it.

Facts and reasons: Niu Lanhua, who lives in a half-wall store in Tiancun, received 25,000 yuan from Gao Fengchi for helping him set up a chicken and duck farm. However, the farm was never established, and the money was not returned to Gao Fengchi. Niu Lanhua claims to have no money to repay Gao Fengchi and it has been more than a year since the incident. Gao Fengchi demands the repayment of the funds and therefore files a lawsuit. Gao Fengchi has submitted an agreement to the court as evidence. Niu Lanhua argues that he does not agree with Gao Fengchi's lawsuit request. He denies borrowing 25,000 yuan from Gao Fengchi and does not recognize the agreement mentioned by Gao Fengchi. After trial, it is determined that Gao Fengchi and Niu Lanhua are friends. During the lawsuit, Gao Fengchi presented a copy of the agreement to the court, which was signed on February 29, 2016. The agreement states that Gao Fengchi and Wang Xiaoli (Wang Tao) are the first party, while Niu Lanhua and Gao Fengchi (Wang Tao) are the second party.

Despite my repeated reminders, the defendant has not repaid the loan. Therefore, I filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting the following: 1. Order the defendant to repay the plaintiff the principal amount of 150,000 yuan in accordance with the law; 2. Order the defendant to pay the plaintiff an interest of 50,000 yuan; 3. The defendant shall bear the litigation costs. The defendant Fan Runping argues that it is true that he borrowed the principal amount of 150,000 yuan from the plaintiff and has not repaid the principal. He used to pay the plaintiff an interest of 7,500 yuan per month, but he cannot remember how many months' interest he has paid. The plaintiff's claim for an interest of 50,000 yuan is excessive, and he is willing to pay an interest of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. After trial and investigation, it is found that on May 10, 2014, the plaintiff and the defendant signed a loan agreement, in which the defendant borrowed 150,000 yuan from the plaintiff, and the loan term was not agreed upon by both parties.

After marriage, we had two children who are now adults. We have no common property, debts, or financial obligations.

There is now no communication between me and the defendant, and we only maintain the title of being husband and wife without real marital relations. The defendant no longer feels any responsibility towards our family. After marriage, the defendant frequently physically and verbally abused me, leading to the breakdown of our marital relationship and the inability to live together. I request the court to grant a divorce and I will bear the court fees myself. The defendant, Mr. Gao, has not responded to the lawsuit nor submitted any evidence to refute the plaintiff's claims. After the trial, it was found that the plaintiff and defendant registered for marriage on February 15, 1981, and had two children who are now adults.

The defendant Li Moumou does not dispute the criminal facts as stated in the indictment and did not provide any defense. The defense counsel argues that Li Moumou's act of arson has relatively mild circumstances, causing minimal losses and limited societal harm. Additionally, Li Moumou voluntarily surrendered after the incident, truthfully confessed to his criminal conduct, and actively compensated the victim for their losses, obtaining their forgiveness. During the trial, Li Moumou pleaded guilty and expressed remorse with a good attitude. Furthermore, it is his first offense and an impulsive act, as he has consistently exhibited good behavior in the past. Therefore, the defense requests a lenient punishment and application of probation for the defendant Li Moumou. The facts ascertained through the trial are consistent with the alleged criminal facts. After the incident, the defendant Li Moumou voluntarily surrendered to the Chengjiao Police Station of Yishui County Public Security Bureau and has already compensated the victim's economic loss of 2000 yuan, obtaining the forgiveness of the victim Liu Deping.

At the same time, the defendant Hu Weidong issued a loan note to the plaintiff. Despite the plaintiff's request for repayment, the defendant refuses to pay back the debt. Therefore, the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit and requests the court to order the defendant to repay the loan and bear the litigation costs. The defendant Hu Weidong argues that the loan is true. The defendant Yang Xiaofei argues that the debt claimed by the plaintiff has nothing to do with the defendant Yang Xiaofei, as she did not borrow money from the plaintiff during her marriage to Hu Weidong. Even if the defendant Hu Weidong did borrow money from the plaintiff, it was not used to purchase a house, so Hu Weidong should bear the responsibility. After trial, it was determined that on March 19, 2015, the defendant Hu Weidong borrowed 100,000 yuan from the plaintiff Wang Qiang and issued a loan note. On the same day, the plaintiff withdrew the money from their Industrial and Commercial Bank and handed it over to the defendant Hu Weidong. After receiving the money, the defendant Hu Weidong deposited 99,000 yuan into their Bank of China account. To prove their claims, the plaintiff submitted one loan note and one bank account statement to the court. The defendant Hu Weidong submitted one bank account statement, and the defendant Yang Xiaofei submitted one bank account statement. Furthermore, it was found that the defendant Hu Weidong and the defendant Yang Xiaofei registered their marriage at the Civil Affairs Bureau of Ningcheng County, Chifeng City on September 6, 2013.",

Therefore, the plaintiff brought this case to the court, requesting a judgment requiring the defendants to fulfill their repayment obligations and bear the litigation costs. The defendants argued that the loan was indeed valid and they should repay the principal and interest to the plaintiff.

Request that the two defendants jointly pay the outstanding debt of 9,900 yuan and transportation expenses of 1,000 yuan, totaling 10,900 yuan; 2. Hold the two defendants responsible for the litigation costs of this case. Facts and reasons: In June 2016, the defendant Yang Yunfei purchased straw paper from the plaintiff in installments. Due to financial constraints, the defendant Yang Yunfei only paid a portion of the payment. After settlement, the defendant still owed the plaintiff 9,900 yuan. On October 9, 2016, the defendant issued a promissory note to the plaintiff. The plaintiff has since repeatedly requested payment from the defendants, but they have made various excuses to delay payment. Therefore, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit to the court. The defendant Yang Yunfei argued that he did not dispute the principal debt claimed by the plaintiff Zhao Jingzhong but disagreed with the transportation expenses, stating that the plaintiff did not incur any transportation expenses. The defendant Zhang Yongli neither appeared in court nor submitted a written defense. After hearing and investigation, it was confirmed that the defendants Yang Yunfei and Zhang Yongli are married. The defendant Yang Yunfei has been purchasing straw paper from the plaintiff since June 2016, and after settlement, he issued a promissory note to the plaintiff Zhao Jingzhong on October 9, 2016, stating, \"Owe Zhao Jingzhong 9,900 yuan in total.\" After multiple requests from the plaintiff, the two defendants have consistently delayed payment, resulting in this litigation. During the trial, the plaintiff requested the defendants to pay transportation expenses of 200 yuan, which the defendants agreed to. The above facts are confirmed by the promissory note provided by the plaintiff and the statements of the parties involved, and are hereby affirmed by this court.",

He Mou entrusted his representative, Xu Moumou, to attend the litigation. Chen Moumou, despite being lawfully summoned by the court, failed to appear in court to defend himself without justifiable reasons. He Mou filed a lawsuit claiming that Chen Moumou borrowed a total of 97,600 yuan from him on three separate occasions, with a principal amount of 65,000 yuan on April 3, 2009, 20,000 yuan on April 21, 2009, and 12,600 yuan on May 21, 2009. He provided three loan notes as evidence of the borrowing. Despite multiple reminders from He Mou, Chen Moumou has not repaid any of the loans. Therefore, He Mou requests the court to order Chen Moumou to repay the borrowed amount of 97,600 yuan. Within the deadline for submitting evidence, He Moumou provided three loan notes to the court to prove the above-mentioned facts. Chen Moumou did not present a defense or provide any evidence. After investigation, the court confirms the following: Chen Moumou, having been lawfully summoned by the court, unjustifiably refused to appear in court, thereby waiving the right to defend and cross-examine. The loan notes provided by He Moumou meet the requirements for valid evidence and are confirmed by the court. Based on this authentication and the statements made during the trial, the court ascertains the following facts: Chen Moumou borrowed 65,000 yuan on April 3, 2009, for the purpose of financing his plastic recycling business. He also borrowed 20,000 yuan on April 21, 2009, with the loan term ending on May 3, 2009, and borrowed 12,600 yuan on May 21, 2009, with the loan term ending on May 30, 2009.

Due to the short duration of our pre-marriage acquaintance, we lacked understanding of each other. After marriage, the defendant became suspicious and possessive, displaying narrow-mindedness and a chauvinistic personality. The defendant repeatedly drove me away, claiming that the house was his personal property. In order to protect the child, I tolerated the defendant's behavior. However, the defendant regarded me as weak and easily bullied. Unable to bear the defendant's provocation and harm, I was forced to leave home on November 8, 2015. It has now been six months, and the marital relationship is completely broken. I request a legal judgment for divorce from the defendant. The defendant should take care of the child, and I will pay a monthly child support of 500 yuan. The common marital property should be divided according to the law. The defendant argues that they do not agree to divorce from me. We met through a mutual acquaintance, and our relationship has been good both before and after marriage. The marital relationship between the defendant and me has not broken down. As the defendant does not agree to divorce, our property does not need to be handled by the court. The defendant also does not agree to take care of the child. After hearing the case, it was found that the plaintiff and the defendant met through a mutual acquaintance and registered their marriage on July 26, 2013. They gave birth to a son, Mr. Fan B, on December 11, 2014. During the trial, the plaintiff claimed that they had limited contact before marriage and had an average relationship after marriage.

The maximum loan amount for a single borrower would not exceed 100,000 yuan, and the total loan amount for the joint guarantee group would not exceed 300,000 yuan. The Small Loan Joint Guarantee Agreement also stipulated that the spouses of Party B (members of the joint guarantee group, including Yang Zhangwei, Feng Dapeng, and Miao Yawei) agreed to jointly assume the repayment responsibility for the loans and guarantees undertaken by Party B under this agreement. Based on the above joint guarantee agreement, on August 22, 2014, the plaintiff, China Postal Savings Bank Co., Ltd. Weixian Branch, signed a loan contract with the defendant Miao Yawei.

After settlement, the defendant issued a promissory note on October 2, 1998, stating, \"I borrowed 175,000 yuan in full from Guo Hongxia. The monthly interest rate is one percent. This document is the basis, and all previous procedures are void.\" However, the defendant has never made any payment. Now the plaintiff sues for a court order to require the defendant to repay the borrowed amount of 175,000 yuan and pay interest (calculated at a monthly interest rate of 1% from October 2, 1998, until the date of full repayment). The defendant, Xuan Zhangfu, has not presented a defense. After trial, the court found that there is a lending relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. On October 2, 1998, the defendant confirmed that he still owed the plaintiff 175,000 yuan with a monthly interest rate of 1%. The defendant has subsequently failed to fulfill the obligation of repayment and interest payment, leading to the plaintiff's lawsuit in this court. It was also found that the plaintiff, Guo Hong, is also known as Guo Hongxia. The above facts were confirmed by the plaintiff's oral statement in court and the plaintiff's household register provided, as well as the promissory note written and signed by the defendant, Xuan Zhangfu. The defendant, Xuan Zhangfu, was summoned by the court but refused to attend the trial without valid reasons, thereby waiving the right to cross-examine the evidence. Furthermore, the plaintiff is willing to bear legal responsibility for the authenticity of the evidence provided. Therefore, the court confirms the authenticity of the promissory note provided by the plaintiff.",

Therefore, the plaintiff sued, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay the plaintiff's payment of 19,100 yuan and interest (calculated from the date of the lawsuit to the actual fulfillment according to the loan interest rate of the People's Bank of China for the same period). The defendant did not respond to the defense. To prove the facts claimed by the plaintiff, the plaintiff submitted a settlement invoice to the court, proving the fact that the defendant owed the plaintiff a total of 19,100 yuan. The defendant did not appear in court to provide evidence or cross-examine, and it is considered as a waiver of its right to present evidence and cross-examine. The settlement invoice provided by the plaintiff has been confirmed as genuine and has evidential value by the defendant's signed confirmation. Based on the evidence and the statements of the parties in court, the court ascertains the following facts in this case: the defendant purchased goods from the plaintiff and after settlement, the defendant owed the plaintiff a total of 27,100 yuan, confirmed by the defendant's signature on the settlement invoice. The plaintiff acknowledges that the defendant has paid 8,000 yuan, and there is an outstanding payment of 19,100 yuan, which is the reason for the plaintiff's lawsuit to this court.",

On the same day, the defendant Wang Bin issued a \"loan agreement\" to the plaintiff Wang Jifu, stating the fact and amount of the loan, and promising to repay it before April 2013. When the loan term expired, the defendant Wang Bin did not fulfill the repayment obligation. After multiple unsuccessful collection attempts, the plaintiff Wang Jifu filed a lawsuit to this court, requesting the following judgments: (1) the defendant Wang Bin is ordered to repay the principal amount of 15,000 yuan and the interest (calculated based on the loan principal of 15,000 yuan, starting from May 1, 2013, and at the interest rate for similar loans set by the People's Bank of China, with the interest accruing with the repayment of the principal); (2) the defendant Wang Bin is responsible for all the litigation costs. The defendant Wang Bin did not appear in court to defend, nor did he submit a written defense to this court. The plaintiff Wang Jifu presents the following evidence to prove his lawsuit request: \"loan agreement\" issued by the defendant Wang Bin to the plaintiff Wang Jifu on February 8, 2013, intended to prove the fact that the defendant Wang Bin confirmed borrowing 15,000 yuan from the plaintiff Wang Jifu, and promised to repay it by the end of April 2013. The defendant Wang Bin did not challenge or provide counter-evidence. After reviewing the evidence, this court has determined that the plaintiff Wang Jifu lent 15,000 yuan to the defendant Wang Bin on February 8, 2013. The defendant Wang Bin issued a \"loan agreement\" on the same day, stating \"I borrowed 15,000 yuan in total from Wang Jifu, to be repaid before April.\" As the defendant Wang Bin did not fulfill the repayment obligation within the promised timeframe, the plaintiff Wang Jifu filed a lawsuit to this court, requesting the judgments as mentioned above.",

The defendant agreed to use their Mercedes-Benz compact car with license plate number Zhejiang DXXXXX (engine number 27695230602658) as collateral, including the full amount of the loan principal, interest, compound interest, penalty interest, and the costs to realize the creditor's rights. The contract also stipulated that if the borrower fails to repay the loan principal or interest on time, the plaintiff has the right to immediately recover all the disbursed loans and charge overdue interest according to the agreement. The plaintiff has the right to prioritize repayment with the proceeds from the discounting, auction, or sale of the collateral. The plaintiff also has the right to request the borrower to bear the costs incurred in debt collection, including lawyer's fees and litigation costs. Both parties completed the mortgage registration, with the motor vehicle registration certificate number as 330016093691. The plaintiff subsequently disbursed the loan according to the agreement. The plaintiff acknowledges that the defendant has paid the loan principal and interest up until September 29, 2016, and there is currently an outstanding principal amount of RMB 407,915.59.",

However, the defendant often argued with me and verbally and physically abused me for various reasons. In May 2014, the defendant once again assaulted me without reason, causing injuries to my head and body. As a result, I could no longer live with the defendant and have been living away from home ever since. Therefore, I request the following: 1) Divorce from the defendant; 2) The division of joint property, which includes a pair of houses (4 shares) and 8 rooms located in Shen Nan Village, Shangxin Township, Huangzhong County, with one tractor to be shared equally by both parties; 3) The defendant shall bear the litigation costs. The defendant, Mr. Xie, was absent and did not present a defense. After review and investigation, it is confirmed that the plaintiff, Mr. Zheng, voluntarily married the defendant, Mr. Xie, after they were introduced by a mutual acquaintance in January 1981. Due to the loss of some marriage records from the People's Government of Shangxin Township, Huangzhong County, the marriage registration certificate of both parties cannot be verified. The couple had three children who are now adults. Initially, their marital relationship was good, but they frequently had disputes over trivial matters during their cohabitation. In May 2014, the plaintiff left the defendant's home and has not returned since.

Despite multiple demands from the plaintiff, the defendant Luo Huishu has yet to repay the loan. The plaintiff has filed a lawsuit and requested the court to order the two defendants to repay the 90,000 yuan loan plus 2% monthly interest. To support his lawsuit, the plaintiff Chen Yonghong has provided two loan documents as evidence to prove the fact that the defendant Luo Huishu borrowed 90,000 yuan from the plaintiff and agreed to the specified interest. The defendants Luo Huishu and Liu Haijun did not appear in court, made no defense, and did not submit any evidence or cross-examination. The court has verified the evidence and found that the two loan documents provided by the plaintiff, with objective and true contents, are legitimate in terms of source and form, and are relevant to this case. Therefore, the court recognizes them as the basis for making a judgment in this case. Based on the plaintiff's statement, evidence submission, the court's evaluation of the evidence, and the trial process, the following facts of the case are confirmed: The defendant Luo Huishu, introduced to the plaintiff Chen Yonghong, borrowed 30,000 yuan from the plaintiff on September 30, 2014, and another 60,000 yuan on January 11, 2015, for real estate investment.

The defendant shall bear the litigation costs.\n\nFacts and reasons:\n\nOn August 29, 2014, Zhang Zijian issued a promissory note to Xing Ligang and signed a \"Guarantee Agreement\" with Zhang Ling. The content of the agreement stated that Zhang Zijian borrowed RMB 50,000 from Xing Ligang, with a one-month repayment period, and Zhang Ling assumed the guarantee responsibility. Upon the expiration of the loan, Zhang Zijian did not repay the loan to Xing Ligang as agreed, resulting in Zhang Ling taking on the guarantee liability. On February 15, 2015, Zhang Ling signed a \"Debt Compensation Agreement\" with Xing Ligang, and repaid the RMB 50,000 loan on behalf of Zhang Zijian. After assuming the guarantee responsibility, Zhang Ling has the right to recover the debt from Zhang Zijian. This debt is a joint liability of the two defendants, and Wu Hongxia should bear the joint liability according to the law. Zhang Zijian and Wu Hongxia did not appear in court and did not submit any defense. Plaintiff Zhang Ling submitted the \"promissory note\", \"Guarantee Agreement\", \"Debt Compensation Agreement\", and \"Receipt\" in support of her claims. The court has reviewed the evidence provided and confirmed it, and added it to the case file. After investigation, the following facts have been identified:\n\nOn August 29, 2014, borrower Zhang Zijian borrowed RMB 50,000 from Xing Ligang, with a one-month repayment period. Zhang Ling acted as the guarantor for this loan. After the loan expired, Zhang Zijian did not repay it as agreed, and Zhang Ling repaid the RMB 50,000 on behalf of Zhang Zijian on February 15, 2015. After the compensation, Zhang Ling repeatedly demanded repayment from Zhang Zijian, but was unsuccessful, hence the lawsuit was filed.",
